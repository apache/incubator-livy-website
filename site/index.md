#### *Submit Jobs from Anywhere*
> Livy enables programmatic, fault-tolerant, multi-tenant submission of Spark jobs from web/mobile apps (no Spark
client needed). So, multiple users can interact with your Spark cluster concurrently and reliably.

#### *Use Interactive Scala or Python*
> Livy speaks either Scala or Python, so clients can communicate with your Spark cluster via either language remotely.
Also, batch job submissions can be done in Scala, Java, or Python.

#### *No Code Changes Needed*
> Don't worry, no changes to existing programs are needed to use Livy. Just build Livy with Maven, deploy the
configuration file to your Spark cluster, and you're off! Check out [Get Started]({{ site.baseurl }}/get-started) to
get going.

### What is Apache Livy?

Apache Livy is a service that enables easy interaction with a Spark cluster over a REST interface. It enables easy
submission of Spark jobs or snippets of Spark code, synchronous or asynchronous result retrieval, as well as Spark
Context management, all via a simple REST interface or an RPC client library. Apache Livy also simplifies the
interaction between Spark and application servers, thus enabling the use of Spark for interactive web/mobile
applications. Additional features include:

* Have long running Spark Contexts that can be used for multiple Spark jobs, by multiple clients
* Share cached RDDs or Dataframes across multiple jobs and clients
* Multiple Spark Contexts can be managed simultaneously, and the Spark Contexts run on the cluster (YARN/Mesos) instead
of the Livy Server, for good fault tolerance and concurrency
* Jobs can be submitted as precompiled jars, snippets of code or via java/scala client API
* Ensure security via secure authenticated communication
